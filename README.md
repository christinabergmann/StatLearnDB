### StatLearnDB (Statistical Learning Database)

Theories of language acquisition and perceptual learning increasingly rely on statistical learning mechanisms. This meta-analysis aims to clarify the effect size and robustness of this capacity in infancy within the word segmentation literature. We focus on direct and conceptual replications of the seminal work by Saffran, Aslin, & Newport (1996). 

Here you can find the database as well as processing and analysis scripts.
